# Background
I have a WindowsToGo System installed in my portable hard drive, and I want upgrade it to Windows11. But I find it impossible to upgrade due to Microsoft's restriction â€” or you can remove this restriction manually by modifying the specific registry key, which is a bit troublesome. So, I came up with the idea of this utility, made it come true, and plan to share it with others.  
Note: This is my first time programming in C#, and this is my first-ever C# work. Not to mention that I have not received any systematic training, the source code might be a bit suck. If you have any suggestions on how to improve the quality of the code, please contact me or submit an issue. You can also try Pull Request (although I don't know how to use it yet).
