# Background
I have a WindowsToGo System installed in my portable hard drive, and I want upgrade it to Windows11. But I find it impossible to upgrade due to Microsoft's restriction â€” or you can remove this restriction manually by modifying the specific registry key, which is a bit troublesome. So, I came up with the idea of this utility, made it come true, and plan to share it with others.  
Note: This is my first time programming in C#, and this is my first-ever C# work. Not to mention that I have not received any systematic training, the source code might be a bit suck. If you have any suggestions on how to improve the quality of the code, please contact me or submit an issue or create Pull Requests.

  - key: `BootDriverFlags`  
  - value kind: dword
  - value: `1` or `20`  
- Path: `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control`  
  - key: `PortableOperatingSystem`  
  - value kind: dword
  - value: `1` or `0`
