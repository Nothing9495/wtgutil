# wtgutil _(WinToGo Utility)_
**wtgutil** is a utility that helps you adjust your WindowsToGo workstation settings more ealisy when you have specific needs like upgrade to newer version of Windosw etc.
# why build this?
I have a WindowsToGo System installed in my portable hard drive, and I want upgrade it to Windows11. But I find it possible to upgrade due to Microsoft's restriction â€” or you can remove this restriction manually by modifying the specific registry key, which is a bit troublesome. So, I came up with the idea of this utility, made it come true, and plan to share it with others.
This is my first time programming in C#, and this is my first-ever C# work, not to mention that I have not yet received any systematic training. So the program code might suck a little bit. If you have suggestions on how to improve the codes, please contact me or submit an issue. you can also try Pull Request (although I don't know how to use it yet).
